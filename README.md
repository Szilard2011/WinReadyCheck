Runs on very old systems (like XP) and checks requirements for various older and newer Windows versions.
Demystifies Requirements: Helps understand complex requirements like TPM version and Secure Boot, especially for Windows 11.

**Simple & Focused:** 
Does one job well â€“ checking hardware compatibility against official minimum specs.
Simulation Mode: Allows you to manually input hardware specifications to test "what-if" scenarios or check requirements for a different PC.

**Features:**
Checks for CPU (Speed, Cores, 64-bit), RAM, Disk Free Space, Firmware (BIOS/UEFI), Graphics (Basic Info), Screen Resolution, TPM (Presence, Version, Status), Secure Boot (Status).
Supports checking requirements for Windows Vista, 7, 8.1, 10, 11.
Runs on Windows XP SP3 (32/64), Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11.
Provides a clear, color-coded PASS/WARN/FAIL report.
Includes an interactive Simulation Mode.
Single, portable .exe file.

**How to Use:**
Download WinReadyCheck.exe.
Run the executable.
Choose [L]ive Detection or [S]imulation Mode.
If simulating, enter the requested hardware specs.
Select the target Windows version key (e.g., "11", "10", "7").
Review the detailed comparison report.

**Limitations:**
Windows 11 CPU check is simplified; refer to Microsoft's official list for definitive compatibility.
DirectX Feature Level and WDDM version detection is basic; manual check via dxdiag recommended for graphics.
TPM/Secure Boot detection reliability is best on Windows 8 and newer. Results may be uncertain on older OSes.
Accurate Secure Boot status may require running the tool as Administrator.
